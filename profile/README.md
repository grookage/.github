### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Grookage is a collection of software applications predominantly written in Java, useful as building blocks to setup an Internet company. 

The various ideas include (not limited to)

- Solving for easy-to-use state machines and workflow engines
- Wrappers around using messaging queues to get started with async workflows
- Building blocks to setup middlewares and API proxies - with sync and async http clients
- Utilitarian offerings such as a maker-checker service with multiple repository bindings, a cataloging and dynamic discovery offering. 
- Performance Engineering tools like Chaos Monkey equivalents
- Data Governance offerings, such as schema registries and schema transformers with message demultiplexing support.
- A scratchy, experimental relational database written in C++

The list may grow with time, and I'll try to add to the list of offerings. Please fork and submit an MR for any bugs/improvements/feature-additions and so on. Cheers!
